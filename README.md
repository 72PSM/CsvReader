# CSV Reader

The [CsvReader](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CsvReader/) library is an extended version of Sebastian Lorien's [fast CSV Reader](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9258/A-Fast-CSV-Reader) project 
and provides fast parsing and reading of CSV files

To this end it is a straight drop-in replacement for the existing NuGet package [LumenWork.Framework.IO](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LumenWorks.Framework.IO/), but with additional
capabilities; the other rationale for the project is that the code is not available elsewhere in a public source repository, making it difficult to extend/contribute to.

Welcome to contributions from anyone.

You can see the version history [here](RELEASE_NOTES.md).
